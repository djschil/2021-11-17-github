## Preliminaries

## Agenda

- What are Git and GitHub?
- How and why could I use them?

# What are Git and GitHub

## Git

- A distributed software version control system
- Developed by Linus Torvalds of Linux fame
- A database for keeping track of the history of changes in text files
- Open-source and platform/operating system agnostic.

## Git wonky

- A `repository or repo` is a collection of related text files
- A `commit` is a time/date-stamped 'version' of a set of text files.
    - Git keeps track of how versions differ.
    - Each version gets its own 'name', e.g., `85c5f7a`
- A `branch` is a part of a project, e.g., `main` or `testing_new_feature`.
    - Git keeps track of branch-specific histories.
- Can `merge` branches.

## GitHub

- A commercial web service: <https://github.com>
- [Acquired by Microsoft in 2018](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2018/10/26/microsoft-completes-github-acquisition/)
- Use Git, but share code with other people

## GitLab

- GitHub not the only game in town
- <https://git.psu.edu>

# How and why could I use them?

## Questions to ponder

- Do I make and edit text files?
    - e.g., data files, R code, SPSS syntax, Python code, HTML, Markdown, etc.
- Do I share making and editing text files with other people?
- Do I want to keep track of the changes?

## Use cases

- Data analysis
- Web sites
